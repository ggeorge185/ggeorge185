## Project Overview

**Duration:** March - May 2025  
**Status:** In Development  

## üîç What it does

Revolutionary emergency response system that analyzes 911 calls using YAMNett sound classification to provide real-time environmental context and situational awareness to first responders.

## Key Features

- **Real-time audio analysis** of emergency calls
- **Environmental sound detection** and classification
- **Context-aware information delivery**
- **Enhanced emergency response coordination**

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- YAMNett sound classification model
- Real-time audio processing
- Machine learning for environmental sound detection
- Emergency response system integration

### Architecture
- Audio stream processing pipeline
- Sound classification engine
- Context analysis module
- Emergency responder dashboard

## Impact & Goals

This project aims to revolutionize emergency response by providing first responders with critical environmental context from the sounds captured during 911 calls. By understanding the acoustic environment, responders can better prepare for the situation they're about to encounter.

## Current Status

Currently in active development with focus on:
- Improving sound classification accuracy
- Developing real-time processing capabilities
- Integrating with emergency response systems
- Testing with simulated emergency scenarios
