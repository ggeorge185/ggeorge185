## Project Overview

**Duration:** November 2024 - January 2025  
**Status:** In Development  

## üåü Vision

Pioneering the future of social media with ephemeral content that prioritizes mental health and authentic connections.

## Innovative Approach

### Core Principles
- **Time-based content lifecycle** - Content naturally expires
- **Mental health-focused design** - Reducing social media anxiety
- **Authentic social interactions** - Encouraging genuine connections
- **Privacy-first architecture** - User data protection by design

### Key Features
- Ephemeral posts that disappear after set time periods
- Mental health tracking and wellness indicators
- Authentic interaction metrics (beyond likes/followers)
- Privacy-preserving social networking

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Backend:** Modern microservices architecture
- **Frontend:** Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Database:** Time-series data management
- **Security:** End-to-end encryption

### Technology Stack
- Node.js/Express for backend services
- React/TypeScript for frontend
- MongoDB for data persistence
- WebSocket for real-time features
- Docker for containerization

## Problem Statement

Current social media platforms often contribute to:
- Mental health issues due to permanent content pressure
- Inauthentic interactions driven by metrics
- Privacy concerns with persistent data storage
- FOMO and comparison culture

## Solution Features

- Positive interaction encouragement
- Mental health resource integration

### Privacy by Design
- Minimal data collection
- Automatic data deletion
- User control over all data
- Transparent privacy policies

## Development Progress

### Completed
- Core architecture design
- User authentication system
- Basic ephemeral posting functionality
- Privacy framework implementation

### In Progress
- Mental health feature integration
- Real-time interaction system
- Mobile application development
- Beta testing platform

### Upcoming
