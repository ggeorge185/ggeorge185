## Project Overview

**Duration:** May - June 2024  
**Institution:** Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg  
**Status:** Completed  

## üéØ Purpose

Ethical AI recommendation system that respects user preferences while promoting responsible food choices through transparent and bias-reduced algorithms.

## Ethical AI Features

### Core Principles
- **Bias-reduced recommendations** - Fair treatment across all user groups
- **Transparent decision making** - Clear explanation of recommendation logic
- **User preference learning** - Adaptive to individual tastes and dietary needs
- **Responsible recommendation algorithms** - Promoting healthy choices

### Advanced Capabilities
- Nutritional value consideration
- Cultural dietary preference awareness
- Allergen and dietary restriction compliance
- Sustainable food choice promotion

## Technical Implementation

### Machine Learning Components
- Collaborative filtering for user similarity
- Content-based filtering for food attributes
- Hybrid recommendation algorithms
- Bias detection and mitigation techniques

### Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python with Flask
- **ML Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for user data
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Deployment:** Docker containerization

## Ethical AI Framework

### Bias Mitigation
- Demographic parity analysis
- Equal opportunity optimization
- Fairness-aware machine learning
